# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation based on demographic and behavioral attributes. It includes preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization of customer segments. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters, enabling businesses to tailor their strategies for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improved customer relationship management.

Features
Synthetic Dataset Creation: Simulates customer data with attributes:

Age
Annual_Income
Spending_Score
Feature Scaling: Applies standardization to normalize data for clustering.

Optimal Clusters Determination: Uses the Elbow Method to identify the ideal number of clusters.

Customer Segmentation: Groups customers into clusters using K-Means.

Cluster Visualization: Visualizes clusters using a 2D scatter plot.

Cluster Analysis:

Displays descriptive statistics (mean, min, max) for each cluster.
Highlights key differences between clusters.
Silhouette Score Calculation: Measures the quality of clustering to evaluate the separation between clusters.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (K-Means, Silhouette Score).
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
